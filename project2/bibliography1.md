Varas, Cornejo, Mainemer, Toldeo, Rogan, Munoz and Valdivia simulate the behavior of pedestrian evacuating a room with a fixed obstacles so that they can find the effect of obstacles in an evacuation. They use the 2D cellular automation model in which pedestrian movement is determined by a static floor field, interaction with others and 'panic'. They experiment the evacuation process by changing the width and position of exit doors. They find that increasing exit width beyond the critical value does not reduce evacuation time and corners of the room are the worst position for an evacuation.
