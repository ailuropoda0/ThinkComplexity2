Motter and Lai characterize the attacks on nodes which can result in a cascade of overload failure in the complex network like the internet and power grids. The conditions they find are (1) heterogeneity of networks and (2) the attack on the node with high load. They show that the homogenous network is more robust against attacks than the heterogenous(scale-free) network and the attack on a single important node with large load can cause the almost entire failure of the network unlike random breakdown.
