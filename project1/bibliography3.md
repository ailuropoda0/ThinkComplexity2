Ohtsuki, H., Hauert, C., Lieberman, E., & Nowak, M. A. (2006). A simple rule for the evolution of cooperation on graphs. Nature, 441(7092), 502.

Ohtsuki, Hauert and Lieberman are motivated from that cooperation is the property of all biological system. They propose the simple graph model in which natural selection prefers cooperation in the certain condition. They assume vertice are divided into two types, cooperators who pay a cost for neighbos to receive a benefit and defectors who only receive benefits from cooperators. They simulate for various graph types(cycle, lattice, random regular graph, random graph and scale-free network) and find the conditon that cooperators spread throughout the graph. They find that the fewer connections, the more cooperation in their model.
